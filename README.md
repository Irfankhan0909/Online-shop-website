The objective of Irfan's Artisan Goods is to design and develop a unique shop specializing in handcrafted home decor items, combining natural and industrial elements. The shop will offer high-quality, artisanal products such as live-edge wood tables, industrial-style lamps, and soy wax wood-wick candles. Each product will be crafted with an emphasis on sustainability, creativity, and authenticity, aiming to provide customers with one-of-a-kind decor that adds warmth and character to their homes.
